      <description>The &amp;ldquo;hungry grass&amp;rdquo; (fear gortach) is said to grow where someone died of famine. Anyone who steps on it is struck by sudden weakness and hunger until they eat.
On the old road near Nephin, a particular patch was marked by a small cairn so travellers could avoid it. The tradition was still recalled by older residents in the mid-twentieth century.</description>

      <description>Flickering lights over the bog near Cloon were explained as the &amp;ldquo;will-o&amp;rsquo;-the-wisp&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ignis fatuus&amp;rdquo;, said to lead travellers into the soft ground. Older people warned children not to follow the lights.
Modern accounts sometimes attribute the phenomenon to marsh gas (methane), but the folk explanation persists in local memory.</description>
