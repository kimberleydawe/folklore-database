      <description>A headless coach is said to drive along the road to Howth at night, drawn by black horses. Those who see it are warned of a death in the family. The coach is sometimes linked to the St Lawrence family or to an unspecified nobleman who broke a promise.
Sightings were still reported in the early twentieth century, especially around the bend near the summit.</description>
