      <description>The banshee is said to wail from the old oak woods near the lakes when a death is imminent in certain families. She is described as a tall woman in grey, combing her long hair.
Several accounts from the nineteenth century agree that the cry was heard before the passing of members of the O&amp;rsquo;Donoghue and related families. One witness reported hearing it three nights in a row before his uncle&amp;rsquo;s death.</description>

      <title>The Fairy Fort at Ballincollig</title>

      <description>A ringfort (rath) near Ballincollig is traditionally avoided after dark. Locals say the fairies still use it, and that cutting the whitethorn around it brings bad luck.
Stories tell of a man who took a shortcut through the fort and lost his way for hours, though the distance was short. Another account describes lights seen moving inside the ring at night.</description>
