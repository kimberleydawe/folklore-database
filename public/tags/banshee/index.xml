      <description>The banshee is said to wail from the old oak woods near the lakes when a death is imminent in certain families. She is described as a tall woman in grey, combing her long hair.
Several accounts from the nineteenth century agree that the cry was heard before the passing of members of the O&amp;rsquo;Donoghue and related families. One witness reported hearing it three nights in a row before his uncle&amp;rsquo;s death.</description>
