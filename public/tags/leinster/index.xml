      <description>St Brigid&amp;rsquo;s Well at Kildare has been a focus of devotion and rounds (turás) for centuries. Pilgrims perform a set number of circuits and recite prayers; the water is used for blessing and cure.
The site is associated with the saint&amp;rsquo;s monastery and the perpetual fire. Rounds are especially common on 1 February (St Brigid&amp;rsquo;s Day) and during the summer.</description>

      <title>The Headless Coach of Howth</title>

      <description>A headless coach is said to drive along the road to Howth at night, drawn by black horses. Those who see it are warned of a death in the family. The coach is sometimes linked to the St Lawrence family or to an unspecified nobleman who broke a promise.
Sightings were still reported in the early twentieth century, especially around the bend near the summit.</description>

      <title>The Púca of Glenmalure</title>

      <description>The Púca of Glenmalure is said to appear as a black goat or a dark horse and lead night-time travellers astray. It is not always malevolent: in one tale it helps a lost man find his way after he speaks to it respectfully.
The glen&amp;rsquo;s isolation and history of rebellion have reinforced local belief in a &amp;ldquo;guardian&amp;rdquo; spirit of the place.</description>
