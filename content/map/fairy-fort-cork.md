A ringfort (rath) near Ballincollig is traditionally avoided after dark. Locals say the fairies still use it, and that cutting the whitethorn around it brings bad luck.

Stories tell of a man who took a shortcut through the fort and lost his way for hours, though the distance was short. Another account describes lights seen moving inside the ring at night.
