Flickering lights over the bog near Cloon were explained as the "will-o'-the-wisp" or "ignis fatuus", said to lead travellers into the soft ground. Older people warned children not to follow the lights.

Modern accounts sometimes attribute the phenomenon to marsh gas (methane), but the folk explanation persists in local memory.
