St Brigid's Well at Kildare has been a focus of devotion and rounds (turás) for centuries. Pilgrims perform a set number of circuits and recite prayers; the water is used for blessing and cure.

The site is associated with the saint's monastery and the perpetual fire. Rounds are especially common on 1 February (St Brigid's Day) and during the summer.
