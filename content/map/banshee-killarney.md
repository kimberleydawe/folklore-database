The banshee is said to wail from the old oak woods near the lakes when a death is imminent in certain families. She is described as a tall woman in grey, combing her long hair.

Several accounts from the nineteenth century agree that the cry was heard before the passing of members of the O'Donoghue and related families. One witness reported hearing it three nights in a row before his uncle's death.
