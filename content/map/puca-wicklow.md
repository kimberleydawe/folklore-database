The Púca of Glenmalure is said to appear as a black goat or a dark horse and lead night-time travellers astray. It is not always malevolent: in one tale it helps a lost man find his way after he speaks to it respectfully.

The glen's isolation and history of rebellion have reinforced local belief in a "guardian" spirit of the place.
