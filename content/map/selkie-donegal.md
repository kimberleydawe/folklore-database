Selkies—seals who shed their skins to become human—are part of Tory's lore. Stories tell of fishermen who hid a selkie's skin so she could not return to the sea and married her; when she found the skin years later, she left.

Other accounts describe selkies guiding boats through fog or warning of storms. The island's dependence on the sea is reflected in these tales.
